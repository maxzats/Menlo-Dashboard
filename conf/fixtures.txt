Through this course, students will gain an in-depth understanding of the history of modern Western art and know how to fruitfully explore and enjoy any art they encounter. In addition to tests, written homework, and oral presentations, all students will write three 3-5 pg. papers and conduct research. Honors students will write an additional review of scholarly articles and complete a 10-pg research paper developed around a topic of their choice.\r\n\r\nThis course is an introduction to how to appreciate and analyze works of art (mostly painting) by looking closely at their visual elements and considering their historical context. The focus on 19th-21st-c Western Art starts with fairly traditional, representational art that focuses on wealthy people and Greco-Roman stories; continues through Impressionism; and then launches into abstraction, installation and performance as art forms. After this course, you will know how to fruitfully explore, discuss and enjoy the art you see in museums and other places.\r\n\r\nHonors students conduct independent research on a topic in the contemporary Bay Area arts scene. Research is then presented in two stages on a public website: an October podcast introducing their artist and a more in-depth December entry. The honors final research project incorporates material from this online journal and will be about 12 pages (for regular students, the final research essay will be about 5-8 pages).
